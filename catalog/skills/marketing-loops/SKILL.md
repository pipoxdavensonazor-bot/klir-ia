## Mission

You help set up **marketing loops** — repeatable marketing workflows an AI agent runs on a cadence, each with a defined trigger, a bounded set of steps, a self-check, and an explicit stopping condition. A loop turns a marketing task you'd otherwise do manually (and forget) into a

## Contexte

Lire `catalog/product-marketing.md` avant de commencer (Klirline). Poser **une seule** question si une info bloque vraiment le livrable.

## How to Use This Skill

**Check for product marketing context first:** if `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md`), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for what's missing.
Then:
1. **Clarify the job.** What outcome should this loop protect or grow? (rankings, ad efficiency, activation, retention, revenue, referrals)
2. **Pick a loop** from the catalog in `references/loop-catalog.md` — or adapt the closest one.
3. **Tune the cadence**

## Anatomy of a Marketing Loop

Every loop in the catalog has these nine parts. When you author or adapt one, fill all of them — a loop missing a stop condition, a self-check, or its state handling is a liability, not an asset.
| Part | What it defines |
|------|-----------------|
| **Check cadence** | How often the loop *looks* (weekly / daily / on-trigger). Match it to signal speed. |
| **Acts when** | The action condition — what must be true to actually *do* something, vs. just check and skip. Most runs of a good loop are "checked, nothing to

## The cadence rule

Match cadence to how fast the signal actually changes — not to how often you'd *like* an update.
| Signal | Realistic cadence | Why |
|--------|-------------------|-----|
| Rankings, backlinks, domain authority | Weekly | Move slowly; daily checks are noise |
| Ad creative fatigue, CPA drift | Every 2–3 days | Meta/Google feedback loops are days, not hours |
| Activation / onboarding funnel | Weekly | Needs enough signups to be significant |
| Churn signals | Daily or on-trigger | Early intervention window is short

## When NOT to loop

Not everything should be automated on a cadence. Skip a loop — or add a mandatory human checkpoint — when:
- **Strategy or creative direction is the real work.** Loops maintain and optimize; they don't set positioning, invent campaigns, or make brand calls.
- **The action publishes or spends without review.** Auto-*drafting* an ad, email, or post is fine. Auto-*publishing* or auto-*shifting budget* needs a human checkpoint unless the user has explicitly authorized autonomous action and set guardrails (caps, allowli

## Scheduling a loop

These loops are agent-agnostic — the *body* works in any agent. The *scheduling* depends on your environment:
- **Claude Code** — native options: `/loop` (self-paced, until a condition), `ScheduleWakeup` (dynamic pacing that reacts to state), and `CronCreate` (fixed cron schedule). If you have a loop-mechanics skill such as `loopify` installed, use it to choose between them and tune delays; otherwise the guidance below is enough.
- **Any agent + cron** — wrap the loop body as a scheduled prompt/script (`0 9 * * 1`

## The Catalog

`references/loop-catalog.md` holds the full library — 43 marketing loops with thorough funnel coverage: SEO & Content, Paid, Earned/Social/Partnerships, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral & Advocacy, and Ongoing Ops. Each is a complete, adaptable spec. Start there, pick the closest match, and tune it to the user's product, stage, and tooling.
